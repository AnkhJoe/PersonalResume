                <p>The research on electric vehicle customer mining and sales decision making is a very meaningful issue, which has anrapid growth has important implications. Companies not only need to improve customer satisfaction with their products and make changes to the performance of thebut also to make more personalized sales plans to customers for the sales of cars. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is tocomprehensively analyze the cleaned data to extract the factors that most influence customers to buy electric cars, and to utilizethese factors to establish a set of reasonable and effective customer mining model for different brands of electric cars.
